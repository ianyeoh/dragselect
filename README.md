# dragselect

A lightweight library that implements a simple click and drag-to-select interaction in the browser, reminiscent of a modern operating system desktop such as Windows/MacOS. The library is written as a TypeScript class consisting of ~300 lines of code, with no dependencies. See it in action [here.](https://ianyeoh.github.io/dragselect/)

This is **not** a package hosted on the npm registry. The class file (dragselect.ts) is intended to be copy and pasted into your codebase, as this allows you to own the code and extend it to fit your exact needs, with no unused code. I wrote this library as a starting point for writing custom drag-select based interactions as I often found it difficult to use out-of-the-box libraries for highly specific use-cases.
